'It's like taking back the word “lesbian”. We take back the word “old”. We honor it. We revel in it...' Armed with
 curiosity, a love of her community, and a recording device, Arden Eversmeyer journeyed across America gathering over 
 eight hundred life stories of old lesbians to create the Old Lesbian Oral Herstory Project. Filmmaker Meghan McDonough
  honors that epic undertaking in this emotional exploration of the voices uncovered, many of whom are no longer with us 
  but will live forever thanks to Arden's work, and this precious film.

         films screened as part of New Irish Shorts represent the breadth of Ireland's 
         film-making talent, concerning lesbian desire, parenthood, drag, HIV, and Gaeilge as
          a secret sapphic love-language. We are honoured to welcome some of the makers with 
          us for a post-show conversation, so please join us. This year, we are excited to 
          introduce a second screening of Irish Shorts with access elements.

        Concerned ponders the gap between public 'concern' around gender, identity, child andparent

<p tabindex="0">
    The hijras in India are the oldest ethnic transgender community in the world, traditionally considered to be a third gender, 
    alternately feared and respected, and attributed with powers for both good luck and bad. Rudrani Chettri is a hijra activist with
     a mission - to elevate her fellow hijra, provide them with opportunities above their usual economic hardship, and make them visible 
     on their own terms.
    
    Spanning seven years, Chettri established India's first transgender modelling agency, facing mockery, indifference, and joy along the
     way. Shocking stories of survival sex work and violence are paired with intense community resilience and humour.

    The film also offers a nuanced and timely examination of what happens when hijra tradition meets the contemporary trans rights 
    movement. Not to be missed.

    From maligned pleasure seekers to disruptive activists, this programme dives deep into an array of subjects 
    that remain risqué within the queer community today. Risky sex takes centre stage in shorts on chemsex and cruising; 
    films face facts with direct action protest and sex worker activism; and intimate relationships are laid bare as an open 
    relationship hits its limits and an illicit coach-athlete affair makes dangerous power plays. With nuance, intimacy and a 
    dose of humour, these seven short films lay bare our blindspots, reminding us who is left out when we only stay in the realms
     of polite conversation.
    <br>
    Presented in proud partnership with the Gay Health Network. There will be a post-screening discussion.

<p tabindex="0">
    Filmmaker Tzeli Hadjidimitriou is an out and proud double Lesbian - that is, a lesbian from Lesbos. Her documentary 
    Lesvia chronicles forty years of life in the small farming village of Eressos on the island of Lesbos, where lesbian 
    women from around the world have been gathering together since the late 1970s. Past and present lesbians speak about 
    the changing nature of life on the island, from both the locals' and newcomers' point of view.
    <br><br>
    A thrilling herstory of the lesbian community emerges, where daring women leave straight society behind, but run into 
    new challenges along the way. With incredible archival material, a history of Sappho and her place in the contemporary 
    Greek imagination, and dozens of charismatic interviewees with divine women make this a must-see for the modern lesbian 
    and Sapphic sis. Come out to the island...

    David Robilliard was a talented British artist who died in 1988, aged just 36 years old, one of the many young gay men of his generation lost to AIDS. In this emotional documentary, the actor and contemporary art devotee Russell Tovey embarks on a quest to bring the life and work of Robilliard back to its rightful prominence.
    <br><br>
    The result is Life is Excellent, a film that gathers together the artist's close friends, collaborators, and colleagues to remember and celebrate a remarkable talent. Through their memories and Tovey's devotion to Robilliard's work, we build a picture of a young dynamic artist full of courage and wit whose legacy deserves to shine.
    <br><br>
    There will be a post screening conversation featuring Russell Tovey, producer Susie Hall, and director Joe Ingham and this year’s Vanguard Award winner, the director of All Of Us Strangers, Andrew Haigh.

</h4>

<p tabindex="0">
    Winner of the 2024 German Film Critics Award, Drifter tells the story of a young gay man, Moritz (Lorenz Hotchhuth), who relocates to Berlin to be with his boyfriend. When their relationship falls apart, Moritz decides to remain in Berlin, gradually allowing all of the city’s compulsions and temptations to play out on his body and mind.
    <br><br>
    The various strange and extreme desires of the people he meets fascinate him, as does his own growing appetite for experience. Fleeting connections come and go, Moritz’s tattoos gradually multiply, but ultimately the young drifter remains lonely and lustful. Hotchhuth gives a wonderfully vulnerable and understated performance as Moritz, but it’s the dark sticky side of the city that is the real star of the film – tempting, dangerous, and never ever still.

    This film screening is proudly supported by the Goethe-Institute Ireland.
